<ul>
<li>
   <strong> Pep Guardiola:</strong> He is the best player I have ever seen. 
   The best thing about him is not what he does but how simple he makes everything look.
   He is not just the best player because he can dribble past three or four players, 
   it is because he does it better than anyone in the world.
</li>
<li><hr><br>
   <strong> Diego Simeone:</strong> Messi is undoubtedly the best player in the world. 
   He’s the determining factor. He’s key, 
   he controls the pace, he directs above all the team’s attack.
</li>
<li><hr><br>
   <strong> Jürgen Klopp:</strong>
   I have coached a few really good players. 
   My dad liked Pele, but Messi is the best ever.
</li><hr><br>
<li><strong>José Mourinho: </strong> 
    Messi is the god of football. When Messi has the ball, one on one, you’re dead.
</li>
<hr><br>
<li>
   <strong>Thiago Alcantara:</strong>
   We give him the ball and stand back and watch. 
   People often say to me they saw Pele and Maradona play. 
   In the future, I will be able to say I saw Messi play.
